                <h3>Our Goal and Objectives: </h3>
The ultimate goal of our projectis to design an online event organizer system through web and mobile app in order to provide customers the best services from different vendors. 
    There are many vendors available for an event to arrange services like venue, food, decorations, and photography. It is very difficult to access various vendor’s information in order to get the best service of all. Also, identifying the vendors in the nearest locations and getting their reviews is very tough. To overcome these problems, our application provides the customers the option to choose vendors suitable to their requirements in the nearby proximity and place the order well in advance through online.
          <h3>Significance: </h3>
          The main significant feature of this project is customers need not visit each vendor’s website individually to know their features, deals or reviews. Instead, they can just register and login to our web application and choose the best vendors and their deals in nearby locations. They can also check the vendor’s previous events and their reviews posted on our website. Also, the user interface will be universal for all the vendors so that the customers can easily access this web application. The event organizer system will be a flexible and user friendly application. It gives the customers the choice of opting best vendors
